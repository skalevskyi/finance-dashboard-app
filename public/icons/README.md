# PWA Icons

This directory should contain PWA icons for the application:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels icon
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels icon

These icons are used when the app is installed as a Progressive Web App.

You can generate these icons using:
- Online PWA icon generators
- Design tools (Figma, Adobe Illustrator, etc.)
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)

Make sure the icons are square PNG files with the exact dimensions specified.
